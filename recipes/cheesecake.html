    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A summer dessert to end a meal? A delicious lemon cheesecake! Of course after a sumptuous lunch it will undoubtedly be more filling than a "sgroppino", the Veneto liquor sorbet, but it will still be fresher than a classic cheesecake: its refined lemon flavor will leave a pleasant sensation in your mouth and your guests will cherish pleasant memories of an evening in your company!</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with the base: place the cookies inside a mixer and blend them into crumbs. Now place them inside a large bowl and add the previously melted butter.</li>
        <li>Now line an 8" cake spring mold (best to use acetate sheets for the edge) and create the cheesecake base with the biscuit mix, by delicately pressing it down with the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Leave the base in the refrigerator to firm up, for around 30 minutes. In the meantime, make the cream. Soak the gelatine in cold water for around 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the lemons and filter the juice 8. Place the ricotta and cream cheese in a bowl and whisk.</li>
        <li>Add the grated lemon zest. Stir some more, add the icing sugar and lemon juice, stirring all the while.</li>
        <li>Now heat the cream in a saucepan and remove from the heat just before it boils; wring out the gelatine and without returning the pan to the stove, add it to the hot cream, stir quickly until fully dissolved. Leave to cool, then gradually add the cheese mixture, stir until thoroughly incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour onto the solidified cookie base, smooth the surface with a spatula and leave in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, to firm up.</li>
        <li>Add the filtered lemon juice and cornstarch. Now beat with a whisk and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat once it boils, add the turmeric and stir to dissolve it.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool, then pour the glaze over the cheesecake and return to the refrigerator for at least another 2 hours to firm up.</li>
    </ol>
