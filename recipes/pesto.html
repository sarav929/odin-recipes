    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pasta and pesto – one of Italy’s iconic first course dishes and one of the best summer recipes there is. Let’s be honest, when you bring pesto alla genovese to the table, it’s always a party, and when it’s the real thing, made with the right ingredients and perfect technique, it’s a whole other story.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Basil (70 g)</li>
        <li>Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese (50 g)</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil (70 g)</li>       
        <li>Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese (50 g)</li>
        <li>Sardinian pecorino cheese (30 g)</li>
        <li>Pine nuts (30 g)</li>
        <li>Garlic 2 cloves</li>
        <li>Coarse salt (3 g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the basil leaves from the stems and place them in a colander</li>
        <li>Rinse quickly under cold running water, then transfer them to a dish towel and dry them</li>
        <li>Remove the germ from the garlic cloves and cut them in half, then place in a marble mortar. Work the garlic with a wooden pestle until you get a cream</li>
        <li>At this point, add the pine nuts and continue to grind</li>
        <li>Always start with pounding movements, then moving on to circular movements 10. Make sure you scrape around the inside of the mortar with a spoon to unstick the ingredients; that way, you’ll get an even pesto</li>
        <li>Once a paste has formed, add the basil leaves and coarse salt</li>
        <li>Once the consistency is creamy and even, add the pecorino, in chunks, and grind in the same way to incorporate it, then add the Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>When all the ingredients have been reduced to a cream, pour in the oil and circle the pestle around for a couple of more minutes</li>
    </ol>
